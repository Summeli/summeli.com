Their newest version of the mobile app fixes this issue, but it also leaks a lot of information about their mobile banking backend. You can see that they are running the backend with Ruby on Rais on AWS, and what depencendies (with version infromation) they have in the mobile backend. Disclosing this information was no... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>pfSense &amp; Lancache 2023 update</title><link href="https://summeli.com/posts/pfsense-lancache-2023-update/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="pfSense &amp; Lancache 2023 update" /><published>2023-05-19T00:00:00+03:00</published> <updated>2023-05-19T00:00:00+03:00</updated> <id>https://summeli.com/posts/pfsense-lancache-2023-update/</id> <content src="https://summeli.com/posts/pfsense-lancache-2023-update/" /> <author> <name>Summeli</name> </author> <category term="pfSense" /> <summary> Minor 2023 update to my pfSense &amp;amp; Lancache configs. I migrated the ethernet ports for Lancache and pfSense in Proxmox, so I got one more ethernet port for Internet accesss. This could be used as a quick adhock connection with Android phone as it turns out that ethernet tethering is working pretty well on Android phones. The odd / even config is still running smoothly. </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Reverse engineering DanskeBank's mobile app for oss-license violations</title><link href="https://summeli.com/posts/reverse-engineering-danske/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reverse engineering DanskeBank's mobile app for oss-license violations" /><published>2023-02-04T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2023-06-20T23:31:07+03:00</updated> <id>https://summeli.com/posts/reverse-engineering-danske/</id> <content src="https://summeli.com/posts/reverse-engineering-danske/" /> <author> <name>Summeli</name> </author> <category term="reverse-engineering" /> <category term="Android" /> <summary> This all started when I opened up the DanskeBank’s mobileapp and I wanted to see what kind of opensource software they are using. I saw that they have software with BSD3-Clause, MIT and ICS-lisences. However, those links only led to SPDX-license boilerplate site. They don’t list the author’s whose software they are using!

Insted of setting weight etc on gatewaygroups we’re load balancing the traffic based on the user’s IP (odd/even). One of be benefits of this setup is, that it’s easy to debug if someone is having a bad Internet connection. We’re also adding upload / download limits per user to keep both of the connections working fo... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Hacking my baby</title><link href="https://summeli.com/posts/hacking-my-baby/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hacking my baby" /><published>2022-09-11T00:00:00+03:00</published> <updated>2022-09-11T22:09:44+03:00</updated> <id>https://summeli.com/posts/hacking-my-baby/</id> <content src="https://summeli.com/posts/hacking-my-baby/" /> <author> <name>Summeli</name> </author> <category term="random" /> <summary> Finnish maternetity clinics gives these smiley face posters to every family. The idea is to put the poster next to the baby threatment table, so the baby would focus to the smiley face and relax.

I had all kinds of nice pastel colors... </summary> </entry> </feed>
