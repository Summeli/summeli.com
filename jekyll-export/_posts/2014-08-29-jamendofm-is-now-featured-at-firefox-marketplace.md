JamendoFM is now on the list of featured music apps at Firefox Marketplace. It’s really nice to see that at least I had some success with this app, after porting it to Tizen, FirefoxOS and Android.  
You can download the JamendoFM for

- FirefoxOS:[ https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/jamendofm](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/jamendofm)
- Android:[ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.summeli.jamendofm&amp;hl=fi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.summeli.jamendofm&hl=fi)
- Nokia store: <http://store.ovi.com/content/505858>
- Tizen: There’s still only the developer phone, so no download link yet.

..maybe I could do one more client for Samsung smart tvs.
