I have been porting the AntSnes to the 5th edition. The reason I have been a bit lazy is that I canâ€™t get the TRK debugger working with N97. So I have been working only with filelogger. That sucks!  
Hereâ€™s some video of the current state of the AntSnes to the 5th edition. Iâ€™m running only the regular c-core in the video, so the final version could be a bit faster with the asm-optimized emulator core. I just canâ€™t get the previous asm-optimized core from 3rd edition to work with the S60 5th edition for some reason, and Iâ€™m too lazy to add all loggings to all sources.. Hopefully the next N97 firmware will help to my debugger problem.

As you can see from the video I can run and jump at the same time, so it really does support 3 buttons at the same time, if the phone is capable of it (nice feature for chrono trigger).  
You might notice that I didnâ€™t use menu to load the ROM, and the reason is that I canâ€™t do it yet. The current version has some issues with the menus on the 5th edition that needs to be solved before I can really release the 5th edition version. But as you can see, Iâ€™m getting there ðŸ™‚  
**Update:**  
The menu problems are now solved. Thereâ€™s only some small tasks before this emu is ready for you guys ðŸ™‚
