the gpSP is a gameboy advance emulator originally written by Exophase. And now it‚Äôs ported to the Symbian OS!  
This is a small patch for the previous version, so no real need to update for Nokia users. However Samsung users might want to test this one üòâ  
I have been a bit lazy in gpsp development. I‚Äôm currently waiting for more stuff from Qt Mobility project. The current version give only 8khz mono audio, while I would like to have at least 22100hz stereo. I still might implement the audio with standard Symbian API‚Äôs. I just would like to wait for the Qt API stuff, since then I would keep the maximum compatibility to Symbian^4 and even to the upcoming Meego. Bot of them should fully support all Qt mobility APIs according to Nokia.

### What‚Äôs new:   

- Support for Samsung i8910
- Polished mainview
- fixed the common settings bug with AntSnesQt
- few other minor bugs fixes

  
### know issues:   

- It‚Äôs a gpsp port, so see the gpsp compatibility list before complaining about non-working ROMs
- Audio is not yet implemented (I‚Äôm waiting for new Qt release with QAudio implementation)
- loading the state freezes the emulator in some games ( don‚Äôt worry, the batterysave still works)
- the emulator crashes if you try to load a ROM without setting the BIOS
- there are some limitations in the ZIP file support, so maybe you have to upzipt the ROMs
- The ZIP files seem to be eating quite a lot of RAM, so If ROM doesn‚Äôt work, try extracting it.
- Samsung blit fails when ‚Äúkeep aspect ratio‚Äù is ticked off

### ZIP limitations**

- WinZip
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Maximum (PPMd) format WILL NOT work.
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Maximum (bzip2) format WILL NOT work
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Maximum (Enhanced Deflate) format WILL NOT run
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Normal format WILL run
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Fast format WILL run.
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Super Fast format WILL run.
- Roms ziped in the WinZip None format WILL run.

### Installation:**  
Same process as with the AntSnes:  
1\. First Install Qt 4.6.3 binaries into your phone

- Nokia users can just download and install this [Download Qt installation package](ftp://ftp.qt.nokia.com/pub/qt/symbian/4.6.3/qt_installer.sis)
- Samsung users: There‚Äôs really no official Qt installation package yet. You can get working Qt libraries by 
    1. installing wikitude i8910 version: <http://www.wikitude.org/>
    2. Check out [faenil‚Äôs QT installation instructions](http://i8910tuning.com/2010/07/22/welcome-to-i8910-qt/)

[ ](ftp://ftp.qt.nokia.com/pub/qt/symbian/4.6.3/qt_installer.sis) 2. Download the gpsp4symbian.sis  
3\. gpsp4Symbian requires the **SWEvent** capability. The SwEvent is required for key mapping: Now you can map call/end call etc. buttons for the gpsp usage. Therefore the following step is required to install the SW.  
Go to SymbianSigned and sign the gpsp4Symbian.sis for your own phone IMEI  
using free Open Signed Online option <https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/public/openSignedOnline.do> this operation should be free of any charge.  
Read carefully the instructions on the SymbianSigned site.  
You must give them

- Your Phone IMEI (you can obtain it digiting \*#06# on your phone)
- Your EMAIL Address
- gpsp4Symbian SIS Package

And then the symbiansigned should email you the signed gpsp4Symbianfor your phone. This package will be installable ONLY on your phone. This procedure works for all Symbian S60V5 Phones. I had also to change to date on the phone into yesterday to get it working..  
The alternative method is to hack your phone! You can find pretty good instructions from [MameXM download site.](https://sites.google.com/site/mamexm/Home/download-1-03) (scroll to the bottom of page: Signing &amp; Installing).  

### Download:   
Download the gpsp4Symbian: [ gpsp4Symbian\_v0.5 (85566 downloads) ](/jekyll-export/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2010/07/gpsp4Symbian_v051.sis)  
Sources are available on Github:[ https://github.com/Summeli/gpSP4Cute](https://github.com/Summeli/gpSP4Cute)[](http://github.com/Summeli/gpSP4Symbian)  

### The Bios:  
Remember to set the correct bios before loading ROMs. Make sure to get an authentic one , it‚Äôll be exactly 16384 bytes large and should have the following md5sum ‚Äúa860e8c0b6d573d191e4ec7db1b1e4f6‚Äù. The Bios extension should be .bin
