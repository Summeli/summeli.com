I have the gpsp port already running on my N97, and it looks really promising. Take a look at the video ðŸ™‚  
The dynarec isnâ€™t stable yet. I can run one track with mario kart, and then it freezes. Itâ€™s same with all other games too. I hope to solve this freeze/crash issue soon, so I can make the release.
