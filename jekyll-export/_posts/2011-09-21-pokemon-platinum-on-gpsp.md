You’ll need Platinum ROM (GBA Converted) and VBA (Visual boy advance for windows) for this hack  
Here’s short description how to do it:  

Step 1 : Drag the Pokemon Platinum game ROM, To VBA (visualboy advanced)  
the emulator should open starting the game   

Step 2 : Click Options on the top left corner, hover you’re mouse over emulator, then save type it normal will be on Flask 64K Change it, click on Flask 128K  

Step 3 : Start playing the game (Z = A//X=B Space speeds up the game) make your character name and go all the way until where you wake up from your dream. once your inside your room in the game press Enter and go down to Save and press Z and save the game. When you do this, the saved file should appear on your desktop named “Pokemon platinum GBA version.sav”   

Step 4 : Tranfer the VBA bios file to phone (and set it later at gpsp file settings)   

Step 5 : Transfer the Save file to your ROM folder with the same name as the ROM into your phone. For example if the game is named as “Pokemon\_platinum.gba”, then save the save file as “Pokemon\_platinum.sav”  
Open gpsp4Symbian, set the new bios and play Pokemon Platinum ![](http://www.sinfuliphone.com/sinfulss/smilies/smile.gif "Smile")   

(PS. You cant make a new game, just press continue you can make multiple save files, you won’t ever need to make a new game because you didn’t even start ![](http://www.sinfuliphone.com/sinfulss/smilies/smile.gif "Smile"))
