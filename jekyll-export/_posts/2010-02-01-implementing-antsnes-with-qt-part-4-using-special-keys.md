### Support for green, red, menu, and camera keys:   

Current S60 v. 5.0 phones really donâ€™t have that much keys, so I decided to add support for all keys that I can find from the phone. This will require the SwEvent capability. The downside is that SwEvent requires signing by user. The signing can be made at [Symbian signed website.](https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/public/openSignedOnline.do)  
Hereâ€™s a trick how to catch these special button events from the phone.

```
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
CAknAppUi* appUi = dynamic_cast<CAknAppUi*> (CEikonEnv::Static()->AppUi());
TRAPD(error,
    if (appUi) {
     // disable other green key functionality to be able to use it
     appUi->SetKeyEventFlags(CAknAppUi::EDisableSendKeyShort|CAknAppUi::EDisableSendKeyLong);
    }
//capturing menukeys, redkey (no), and camera keys
iMenuKeyHandle = CEikonEnv::Static()->RootWin().CaptureKeyUpAndDowns(EStdKeyApplication0, 0,0);
iNoKeyHandle = CEikonEnv::Static()->RootWin().CaptureKeyUpAndDowns(EStdKeyNo, 0, 0);
iNoKeyHandle2 = CEikonEnv::Static()->RootWin().CaptureKey( EKeyNo, 0, 0 );
iCameraKeyHandle = CEikonEnv::Static()->RootWin().CaptureKey( EKeyDevice7, 0, 0 );
```

There are limitations in these keys also. The green and red button are sending the KeyUp events, even if I would hold the button down. So these keys shouldnâ€™t be mapped into keys that require long key presses.  
### Adding support for multimedia buttons:

Thereâ€™s are very good forum.nokia article about how to utilize multimedia keys: [http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/TSS000432\_-\_Utilising\_media\_keys](http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/TSS000432_-_Utilising_media_keys). I utilized the multimedia keys in similar ways, and after that Iâ€™ll make a KeyEvent with Qtâ€™s Event:

```
QKeyEvent *event = NULL;
event =Â  QKeyEvent::createExtendedKeyEvent( QEvent::KeyPress, KPlayButtonPress, Qt::NoModifier,
 KPlayButtonPress, KPlayButtonPress,Qt::NoModifier);
QCoreApplication::postEvent (receiver, event);
```

These eventâ€™s can be sent to the receiver object, which can use the key events as any other normal keys. However multimedia keys also have some limitations ðŸ™‚ The play and stop keys are not sending the keyup events at all. Therefore I had to set a initial time how much it takes until the keyup event is generated. Initially I set the timeout to 80ms. It seems to be working quite well ðŸ™‚  

### Summary about button limitations:

For red/green keys the user must sign the application in symbian signed, or I have to buy a cert and get the applicaiton signed. Iâ€™m probably not going to do that, so itâ€™s more work for the user.  
Currently there are four buttons that doesnâ€™t support long key presses. I tested these only with my N97. Other phones might behave differently.  
green/red buttons: automatic keyup event after some time  
play/stop button: automatic keyup event after 80ms.
