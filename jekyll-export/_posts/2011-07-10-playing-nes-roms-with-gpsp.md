**Playing NES ROMs with gpSP**  
You can play some NES games with gpsp with the help of the [PocketNES](http://www.pocketnes.org/downloads.html). You can convert the NES ROMs into GBA ROMs with following process.

1. Download the PocketNes MenuMaker and PocketNES.gba files into your pc.
2. Set the PocketNES.GBA file in the MenuMaker settings
3. use the MenuMaker to pach a NES ROM into GBA ROM.

I tested this only with few games, and I know that it works at least on some level with some ROMs. No guarantees ðŸ˜‰  
Please **do not add NES games** to the gpsp compatibility list. Itâ€™s primary a GBA emulator after all.
