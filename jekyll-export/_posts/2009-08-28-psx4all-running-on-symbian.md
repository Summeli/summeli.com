Iâ€™m currently porting gpSP to the Symbian. Psx4all uses pretty much same SDL stuff and same ARM assembly emitter as gpSP. I just took my porting tricks from gpSP and compiled them with psx4all and here is the result. Itâ€™s really not fully optimized yet, but youâ€™ll get the idea that itâ€™s not going to run on N95 smoothly ðŸ™‚ I still have some other tricks that would speed it up, but not enough.  
Itâ€™s just a proof of concept that this emu could be ported to Symbian with moderate effort, but itâ€™s going to require a lot faster CPU. I might take a second look of this after Iâ€™ll get the gpSP port finished.  
See the performance by yourself.
