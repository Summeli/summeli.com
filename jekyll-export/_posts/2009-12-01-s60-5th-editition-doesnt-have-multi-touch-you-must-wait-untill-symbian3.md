I fixed the touch keys on the recent AntSnes 0.71 release. I though that I could support multi-touch in my application. I mean that there‚Äôs nothing preventing it to happen üôÇ It should just work.  
Well, the thing is that there‚Äôs no multi-touch in S60 5.0! So there‚Äôs also no multi-touch on Samsung i8910. Therefore I‚Äôm not wondering anymore why Nokia uses only those crappy resistive displays.  
According to [ Symbian roadmap](http://developer.symbian.org/wiki/index.php/Roadmap_for_UI) the multi-touch is coming in Symbian^3. The Symbian^3 should come sometime at 2010. The chances of getting the multitouch to the AntSnes before that are close to 0.    

Before posting comments about ‚ÄúLondon Defend‚Äù take a look at this [http://kgronholm.blogspot.com/2009/07/n810-multitouch-f-f-f-fun.html  ](http://kgronholm.blogspot.com/2009/07/n810-multitouch-f-f-f-fun.html). So the multitouch is feasible with few keys even with resistive display and Symbian. But Snes has 12 keys plus antsnes key for the menu, so it‚Äôs really not going to work.
