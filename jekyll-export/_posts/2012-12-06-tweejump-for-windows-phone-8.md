I started my wp8 development by playing around with Cocos2d-x port for wp8. I also used this start by participating to the forum.nokia wiki-competition with my article about [Porting Cocos2d-x Games for Windows Phone 8](http://www.developer.nokia.com/Community/Wiki/Porting_Cocos2d-x_Games_for_Windows_Phone_8). You can see the port running on the video below. I had really good time with cocos2-x, and I think that I might even make my own game based on this framework. Itâ€™s really easy to use, and you can port the games created with it so easily to iOS, and for Android as well.
