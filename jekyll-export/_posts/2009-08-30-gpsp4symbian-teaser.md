I have been porting the gpPS to Symbian for a while now and itâ€™s finally running! There is still a lot to do. For example UI, audio and some config stuff, but the actual core is now working. You can get a pretty good estimate about the speed from the video. Itâ€™s really not as fast as I hoped, but you should still be able to play some games with it. At least it should be better with newer phones and faster processors ðŸ˜‰
