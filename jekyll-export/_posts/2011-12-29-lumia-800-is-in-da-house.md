After feb11 when Nokia killed both Symbian and Meego I have been thinking what should be my next platform. I have been casual Android user, and I have to admit that I donâ€™t like it much, plus it already has all of my favorite emulators ported into it, so I couldnâ€™t figure out anything that I would want to develop for it( it kind of already has everything already).  

Today I got the Lumia 800 from nokia launchpad, and I have to admit that I really like the device a lot. All the basic apps are scrolling at 60fps, and I can acess facebook and twitter really well. However it does not yet have any cool app, sucs as emulator on it (yet), so itâ€™s an interesting platform.    

In spec vise the Lumia seems also pretty nice device. It has Qualcomâ€™s MSM8255 -SOC, which contains 1,4 Ghz AMR Cortex A-8 processor and [Adreno 205 GPU](https://developer.qualcomm.com/discover/chipsets-and-modems/adreno), which is plenty for games and emulators.

### Emulators on wp7   
The problem is that currently the wp7 doesnâ€™t support native code for 3rd parties, so youâ€™re stuck with the C#. Luckily thereâ€™s also some progress even on that area, as we can see on the XDA-developers forum: <http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1299134> Youâ€™re also going to have to jailbreak you phone with some jaibreak. The most recent jailbreak project is WindowBreak [http://windowsphonehacker.com/articles/the\_windowbreak\_project-12-23-11](http://windowsphonehacker.com/articles/the_windowbreak_project-12-23-11)  

### Whatâ€™s next    
Iâ€™ll also start hacking with the wp7, and see what I can do with it ðŸ™‚
