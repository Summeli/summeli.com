I‚Äôm still waiting for Nokia to release new Qt libs to get the QGLWidget working on Symbian^3. The QGLWidget is required to the the OpenGL ES based blit working with Qt and Symbian. Nokia already released the sis-files with QGLWidget support [http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/Qt\_4.7\_for\_Symbian%5E3\_-\_developer\_version ](http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/Qt_4.7_for_Symbian%5E3_-_developer_version), but they still haven‚Äôt released the libs, so I can not link to the QGLWidget üôÅ  

While waiting for better Symbian^3 support for my stuff you can play with [AntSnes 0.72 ](/1699) and with [Numpty Physics](/1891). You can see the slowness of DirectScreenAccess on them both. I think that even my N97 has faster blit with DSA than N8.  

I also added a category for [Symbian^3 compatible](/categories/symbian-3/) releases.
