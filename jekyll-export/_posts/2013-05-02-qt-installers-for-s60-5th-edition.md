I found out that the ftp.nokia.com do not host the Qt installer sis files anymore, so I decided to try to find them and host them in here.  
Here are the installers **Qt 4.6.3** (gpsp needs these):

- Nokia S60 5th edition devices: [ Qt 4.6.3 for S60 5th edition (24771 downloads) ](http://summeli.com/download/11294/ "Version 1")
- Sony Ericsson Satio devices: [ Qt 4.6.3 for SE devices (3274 downloads) ](http://summeli.com/download/11296/)
- Samsung i8910, try the same package as for Satio. If you have a better one, plase share it with me, so I can put it into here.

Iâ€™m not sure if the installer for SE satio is the â€˜official oneâ€™ or modded, but it should work.

Here are the installers **Qt 4.7.3** (antsnes needs these):

- Nokia S60 5th edition devices: [ QT 4.7.3 for S60 5th edition (5049 downloads) ](http://summeli.com/download/11298/)

Qt Mobility 1.1.13 for S60 5th Edition

- <span style="line-height: 13px;">Nokia S60 5th edition devices [ Qt Mobility 1.1.3 for S60 5th edition (3412 downloads) ](http://summeli.com/download/11300/)</span>

As you can see Iâ€™m still missing Qt Mobility and Qt 4.7.3 installers for Samsung and Sony-Erisson.  
Faenil made some Qt packages which worked with SE and Samsung devices, but I canâ€™t find it anymore. If you still have it, maybe you could give that one for me ðŸ™‚
