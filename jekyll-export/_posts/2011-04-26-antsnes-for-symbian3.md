Thanks for clpalmer:

For those of you who want a better experience on S^3, hereâ€™s a modified version of AntSnes that supports multitouch and has full set of on-screen buttons. Also runs much faster, close to 60 FPS w/out sound and usable with it. The audio might sound a bit glitchy at the moment, though, due to some optimizations.  
This is completely un-official and Summeli can re-release this when he finds time through his proper channels and with the source, but at least hereâ€™s something to play with in the meantime.  
Requirements: S^3 device with Qt 4.7.2 or 4.7.3 libraries installed

**Update:**  
For those of you who want audio to work a bit better, give this a go:

Was only trying to get multitouch, full onscreen keyboard and better FPS with my last one so didnâ€™t care that audio was a bit borked.  
This one should improve audio glitchyness, but might be a bit slower when audio is enabled.  
Again, not an official release, and Summeli will do that when he sorts his stuff out.

**Yet another update ðŸ™‚ This one is to hopefully re-enable hardware key mapping.**

Again, wasnâ€™t paying attention to hardware keys when I didnâ€™t the mods as N8 doesnâ€™t really have many you can use anyways. In any case, this should hopefully fix it. The only keys you can map, at least on N8, are the light-press camera key (donâ€™t hard press or youâ€™ll exit) and the volume keys, but the volume keys act wierd because hitting them seems to deliver two sets of key down/up events. Youâ€™ll notice that if you hold them, you get a brief press, then a release, then another press until you release it.  
Hopefully will work better for other keys on keyboard or attached controllers. Let me know if itâ€™s still busted.

Iâ€™ll tweak the buttons a bit, and then Iâ€™ll make a new version.
