This is just an initial release to gain some feedback how the port is currently working. I would like to know if you get any games running at correct speed. The first number in the fps-counter is telling how fast the emulator is running( it should be 60). If you do get something running at that speed, please also test the audio then. I have some tricks planned for the audio, but thereâ€™s really no point of doing it, if it doesnâ€™t run fast enough.  
Please list some games in the comments that you got running well, so I can test the audio with those. Itâ€™s really no point of tweaking audio, if the game doesnâ€™t run well. Tell also what phone you are using. It would be very interesting to have some results from phones with 600Mhz ARM processor.

**Know issues:**

- key config is missing
- only one game can be loaded with each run
- audio may not work well. I really didnâ€™t have a good setup to test it.
- You should turn audio on after a game has been loaded. Turning the audio on before loading the game will crash the emulator.
- The emulator requires a lot of CPU power. It really doesnâ€™t work with my N96 or N73

**KEYCONFIG**  
There is no keyconfig yet available, so youâ€™ll have to bear with these for a while. up/down/left/righ form the d-pad  
4: L  
5: A  
6: start  
7: R  
8: B  
9: select  
\#: save state  
\* :load state  
left softkey: menu  
  
**Installation**  
Install the emulator from the sis file, and then place the following files under E:\\GBA folder

- game\_config.txt  
    You should find this file with the installation package
- gba\_bios.bin  
    You should find this on your own. Please **donâ€™t post links to this file in the comments.** Make sure to get an authentic one, itâ€™ll be exactly 16384 bytes large and should have the following md5sum value: a860e8c0b6d573d191e4ec7db1b1e4f6
- put also ROMâ€™s under E:\\GBA folder

Also Nokiaâ€™s OpenC plugin is required. So if you donâ€™t have it, then you should install it asap.  
And now youâ€™re done. Have fun! ðŸ˜‰  
**Credits:**  
This emulator is based on gpsp originally written by Exophase. It also uses SDL port by Anotherguest. Symbian porting was made by me, Summeli.
