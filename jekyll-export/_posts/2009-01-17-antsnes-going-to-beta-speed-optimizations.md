The new version is optimized for speed, which gives a huge performance boost for N96 (itâ€™s nice for N95 too).  
I expect this binary to work with S60 3.1 and 3.2 phones, but Iâ€™m planning to add support for 3.0-&gt; phones in the future. Currenlty there is only the landscape mode, but I will make new blitters for portait mode too.

</div>N95 users: You still have to map keys 1-4 with Magic keys [as with alpha version.](http://www.summeli.com/?p=28) The Opengl ES support is not included in this release, since DSA rendering is now an option for N95 users too. Howerver I think that the sound support might be possible with OpenGL ES rendering. To be tested..
