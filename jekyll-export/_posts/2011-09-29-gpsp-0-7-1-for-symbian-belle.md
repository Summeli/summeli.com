the gpSP is a gameboy advance emulator originally written by Exophase. And now it’s ported to the Symbian OS!  
This version supports only Symbian^3 phones with Symbian Belle update installed (N8, E7 etc.). The old Symbian Anna users should still use the older [gpSP 0.7.](http://www.summeli.com/?p=2520) The S60 5th edition users should use the [gpsp 0.6.5 for S60 5th edition](http://www.summeli.com/?p=2557)  
**What’s new:**

- Support for Symbian Belle

**know issues:**

- **Mounted shares(Dropbox etc.) breaks the filemanger, so do not use mounted shares.**
- It’s a gpsp port, so see the gpsp compatibility list before complaining about non-working ROMs
- the emulator crashes if you try to load a ROM without setting the BIOS
- there are some limitations in the ZIP file support, so maybe you have to upzipt the ROMs
- The ZIP files seem to be eating quite a lot of RAM, so If ROM doesn’t work, try extracting it.

**ZIP limitations**

- WinZip
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Maximum (PPMd) format WILL NOT work.
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Maximum (bzip2) format WILL NOT work
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Maximum (Enhanced Deflate) format WILL NOT run
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Normal format WILL run
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Fast format WILL run.
