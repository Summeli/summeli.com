AtnSnes is Snes9x emulator for Symbian. It is actually based on [DrPocketSNES](http://reesy.gp32x.de/DrPocketSnes.html "DrPocketSNES") version 6.4.4, which in turn is based on snes9x 1.39  
The new AntSnes comes with multitouch and with new transparent keys. You’ll need a Symbian^3 based phone with Symbian Belle update to run this (N8, C7, E7 etc..). The Symbian Anna users should still stick up with the older [AntSnes 0.8.6](http://www.summeli.com/?p=2581) The old S60 5th edition is not supported by this version anymore. S60 5th edition users should use [AntSnesQt 0.7](http://www.summeli.com/?p=2386)  
I heard that this isn’t working with all Belle versions… So if the 0.8.7 doesn’t work, then try to use the [AntSnes 0.8.6](http://www.summeli.com/?p=2581)  
**What’s new**

- Symbian Belle support

**Known issues:**

- Mounted shares(Dropbox etc.) breaks the filemanger, so do not use mounted shares.
