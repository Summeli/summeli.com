I just took the psx4all stuff from S60 3rd edition port and put that running on my N97 with my Qt stuff, which I have previously used for AntSnes and gpsp4Symbian.  
Itâ€™s really slow as I expected, but I think that it was worth of couple of hours work. Now I have pretty nice benchmarking SW for the N8 ðŸ˜‰  
Hereâ€™s the psx4all running Final Fantasy VII on my old N97. The video runs in 4x speed after I click the new game button. Notice how well the 320Ã—240 original psx resolution scales up to the N97â€™s 640Ã—360.

Update: Iâ€™ll probably abandon this work in favor for a new psx-dynarec emu called pcsx4all. It seems to be a lot better than psx4all. See this forum thread for more info <http://www.gp32x.com/board/index.php?/topic/55665-pcsx4all/>
