AtnSnes is Snes9x emulator for Symbian. It is actually based on [DrPocketSNES](http://reesy.gp32x.de/DrPocketSnes.html "DrPocketSNES") version 6.4.4, which in turn is based on snes9x 1.39  
The new AntSnes comes with multitouch and with new transparent keys. You’ll need a Symbian^3 based phone to run this (N8, C7, E7 etc..). The old S60 5th edition is not supported by this version anymore.  
Thanks for clpalmer for audiofixes and multitouch support!  

### What’s new   

- Audio is working
- Multitouch
- Transparent keys on top of the UI
- Symbian^3 support
