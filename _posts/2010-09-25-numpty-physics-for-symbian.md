The fabulous [NumptyPhysics](http://numptyphysics.garage.maemo.org/) game by Tim Edmonds for Linux and Internet Tablets. It was also one of my favo0rite games on N810, and now itâ€™s ported to your Symbian^1 phones ðŸ™‚  
Numpty Physics is a drawing puzzle game in the spirit (and style?) of [Crayon Physics](http://kloonigames.com/crayon) using the same excellent [Box2D engine](http://www.box2d.org/).  
### Keys

- stylus/finger â€“ draw a new stroke
- tap proximity sensor â€“ undo last stroke
- volume up â€“ menu
- volume down â€“ reset level to initial state
- long tap left/right corners to get extra menu options (you really donâ€™t need these)

### Port information:**  
Iâ€™ve made some minor changes that change some of the platform-specific behavior and compiled it to run under Symbian OS using SDL port by [AnoterGuest](http://www.embeddev.se/agroot/).  

### Source code:   
You can download sources of my port from my[ Numpty Physics GitHub page](http://github.com/Summeli/numptyphysics-symbian). I also made some minor changes into the Symbian SDL port, which you can find from my [SDL Page at GitHub](http://github.com/Summeli/SDL_Symbian).
