the gpSP is a gameboy advance emulator originally written by Exophase. And now it’s ported to the Symbian OS!  
It seems that Nokia has changed something with Symbian memory management in new Symbian Belle refresh update, and it seems that the old gpsp 0.7.1 doesn’t work anymore after Belle refresh update. This version contains minor adjustments to the memory management to make it will work with Symbian belle refresh again.  
This version supports only Symbian^3 phones with Symbian Belle refresh installed (N8, E7 etc.). The old Symbian Anna users should still use the older [gpSP 0.7.](/2520) The S60 5th edition users should use the [gpsp 0.6.5 for S60 5th edition](/2557)  
**What’s new:**

- Support for Symbian Belle Refresh

### Know issues:   

- **Mounted shares(Dropbox etc.) breaks the filemanger, so do not use mounted shares.**
- It’s a gpsp port, so see the gpsp compatibility list before complaining about non-working ROMs
- the emulator crashes if you try to load a ROM without setting the BIOS
- there are some limitations in the ZIP file support, so maybe you have to upzipt the ROMs
- The ZIP files seem to be eating quite a lot of RAM, so If ROM doesn’t work, try extracting it.

### ZIP limitations   

- WinZip
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Maximum (PPMd) format WILL NOT work.
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Maximum (bzip2) format WILL NOT work
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Maximum (Enhanced Deflate) format WILL NOT run
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Normal format WILL run
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Fast format WILL run.
- Roms ziped in the WinZip Super Fast format WILL run.
- Roms ziped in the WinZip None format WILL run.
