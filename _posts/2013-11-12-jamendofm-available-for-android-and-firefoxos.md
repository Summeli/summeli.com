### JamendoFM in Google Play

First I must warn you that JamendoFM is worst kind of Android application. It basically shows all the problems with html5 applications for mobile. It’s slow, and the playback will cut off when the lockscrene activates. I don’t think that there’s a solution for these issues For Android in Phonegap (there are some options for iPhone, but not for Android)  
You can download JamendoFM from Google Play at: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.summeli.jamendofm>

### JamendoFM in Firefox Store

The Firefox app is much better than the one in the Google Play. The performance is decent even on low end device such as the GeeksPhone, and it also plays music under the lock screen.
