AtnSnes is Snes9x emulator for Symbian. It is actually based on [DrPocketSNES](http://reesy.gp32x.de/DrPocketSnes.html "DrPocketSNES") version 6.4.4, which in turn is based on snes9x 1.39  
The Symbian days are over for me, and I finally uploaded the app into the Nokia store ðŸ™‚ The Nokia QA guys didnâ€™t like the mario icon, so I had to remove it, and use crappier icon instead. This version should work with all Symbian Anna and Bellle phones.  

### Whatâ€™s new   

- new crappy icon, since the mario icon didnâ€™t pass nokia QA ðŸ™‚
- now available in nokia store

### Known issues:    

- Mounted shares(Dropbox etc.) breaks the filemanger, so do not use mounted shares.
- Does not work on Nokia 500, since it doesnâ€™t have GPU.
