Would you rather use AntSnes in your native language? With your help it could be possible with the next AntSnes release. At least Russian translation was requested. However I canâ€™t speak Russion, so I canâ€™t do the localization. Now you can contribute to the AntSnes project by translating the strings used in the AntSnes to you native language.  
First download the Original [AntSnes English Strings](http://www.summeli.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/antsnesstring.zip). There are three language files in the zip, and all of them needs to be translated for full localization.  
Then translate the strings, and save to files in format AngSnesGeneralStrings.lxx, where xx is the Symbian OS language code for you language. You can find the language codes on the table below. For example Russian files should be name as AntSnesGeneralStrings.l16.

Make a zip-file from you new translated language files and send an email for me to summeli @ remove spam summeli . fi. Iâ€™ll make a translation credits to the next release notes, so you can tell me a nick or an email to the translation credits, if you like.  
The new release in June, so youâ€™ll have at least couple of weeks to make the translation. Iâ€™ll be on holiday at July, so donâ€™t expect to get any updates soon after 0.6 release.

**Thanks for all translators. The new release is ready, and I donâ€™t need any more translations for that. There might be a new localization round before next release.**
