The 5th edition version is finally ready. I had N97 to test it with, and it runs really well with it üôÇ The keypad works really well! Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt have a Samsung‚Äôs I8910 to test the capacitive touch so I really can‚Äôt tell if it works, so feedback is welcome.  
The project has now a [wikipage at github](http://wiki.github.com/Summeli/AntSnes). So if you‚Äôll find any good configs you can post them into the wiki page too.  
**know issues:**

- Audio doesn‚Äôt quite yet work
