The new AntSnes release 0.3 is now ready. The current release contains mainly minor bug fixes and improves usability. The sound support is still missing üôÅ  
Whats new:

- can load more than one rom, when launched üôÇ
- shows only supported fileformats on LoadROM dialog
- Menu is opened at startup (no more black screen)
- more save slots
- The emulation is paused, when menu is opened

**Installation:**

1. Install P.I.P.S 1.3(or later if available) to the phone (pips\_nokia\_1\_3\_SS.sis)  
    You will probably find this file faster by googling it, but if you‚Äôre out of luck, you can extract it from official nokia plugin, which can be donwloaded from [forum.nokia](http://www.forum.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/91d89929-fb8c-4d66-bea0-227e42df9053/Open_C_SDK_Plug-In.html#http://www.forum.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/91d89929-fb8c-4d66-bea0-227e42df9053/Open_C_SDK_Plug-In.html). This step is not required for all S60 3rd edition phones, so you can also try to skip this phase.
2. Install AntSnes.
3. Enjoy

**AntSnes settings:**  
There is two different graphic modes, the n-gage mode and portrait. The portrait mode is the default. It‚Äôs meant for most 3rd edition phones(phones without ‚Äún-gage mode‚Äù). The orientation modification takes effect, when AntSnes is started next time( a restart required).  
The N-gage mode is meant for phones with ‚Äún-gage mode‚Äù like N95 and N96. The N96 can use the multimediakeys by default, but N95 users must use [Magic keys](http://www.symbian-freak.com/downloads/freeware/cat_s60_3rd/descriptions/systools/magic_keys_remap_and_extend_your_keyboard.htm) to map keys 1-4 to multimediakeys.
