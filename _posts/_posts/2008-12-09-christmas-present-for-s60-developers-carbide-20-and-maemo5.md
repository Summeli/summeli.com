Nokia just released [Carbide 2.0](http://www.forum.nokia.com/Resources_and_Information/Tools/IDEs/Carbide/). And the big news is that itâ€™s free, even the OEM edition, which was about $1200 in the past. I know that 3rd party developers donâ€™t require the OEM edition features, but itâ€™s still nice to receive that for free. I was able to start my own snes9x port, because I got the carbide 2.0 beta program and therefore I was able to do on device debugging and profiling (PRO edition features) for free. It seems that I will be able to continue my development for free in the future.  
I have been slaking from my porting work for couple of months now. I have been busy ðŸ˜‰ But I still intend to continue this port. Maybe I will just make some alpha release even without sound (if I get the emulator running at decent speed).  
Nokia also released[ Maemo 5.0 pre-aplpha SDK](http://maemo.org/development/sdks/maemo_5-0/). The new release seems quite nice. It already contains X11-opengl support. Currently I have some experience with Snes9x, Maemo and Opengl ES, so maybe I will make a snes9x port to Maemo too.
