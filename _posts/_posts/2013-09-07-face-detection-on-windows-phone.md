Developer.nokia.com organized an Imaging challenge for developers. I haven’t done much with wp8 lately, so I decided to take part to the competition. The [winning articles](http://developer.nokia.com/Community/Wiki/Nokia_Imaging_Wiki_Competition_2013Q3#The_Winners) were really good, and this time I wasn’t one of them. But it doesn’t matter I had a lot of fun with facial recognition on Windows Phone. You can find my article from Nokia wiki: [http://developer.nokia.com/Community/Wiki/Detecting\_Faces\_on\_Windows\_Phone](http://developer.nokia.com/Community/Wiki/Detecting_Faces_on_Windows_Phone)  

I ported the [facedetectwp7 ](http://facedetectwp7.codeplex.com/) library to the Windows Phone 8, and I added a new simple example app showing how to use the library. You can get my wp8 port from my github-repo: <https://github.com/Summeli/FaceDetectionWP8>    

Here’s the example application from facedetect library in action:

### Windows Store

You can also play with this example just by downloading the app from Windows Store: <http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=41237b2c-eb3f-4dfa-be0b-3aaf28bf6afe>
