AntSnes is a Snes9x port to S60 3.x.  
Whats new:

- Battery saves
- New fancy icon
- savestate bug fixed. 0.5 users see known issues!
- Modified key config. All 0.5 version users must update the key config after this Release.  
    After settings the screen to the N-gage mode the user must set keys again, since the S60 keypad doesn‚Äôt know that feature. The update was made for E75 users, who might not have the d-pad mapped for arrow keys
- Localization for: Danish, Hungarian, Indonesian, Brazilian Portuguese and Russian besides the English.
- Don‚Äôt like the localization? No prob. You can just download the English only package too.

know issues:

- Audio still sucks!
- due to a bug in previous 0.5 version the save/load slot places have changed. Try to find you own correct save slot. Doesn‚Äôt affect to users who haven‚Äôt used the previous version..
- **The OpenGL ES does not work. There is a fix coming soon..**

Thanks for the localization goes to following persons:

- Danish 07 by: Jens kikkenborg
- Hungarian 17 by: Attila Moln√°r
- Indonesian 59 by: Antok
- Brazilian Portuguese 76 by: Rodrigo Caruso
- Russian 16 ‚Äì Chepelev Anton
- Polish 27 ‚Äì Krzysztof Urbanowicz

Did you want to make translation for your own native language, but missed AntSnes release 0.6? Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll get a new chance later when I‚Äôm making a port for the S60 5th edition.  
  
### Installation:
Just download and install  

### Video settings:
Video Renderers: A restart is required after video renderer has been changed

- DirectScreenAccess -Default, works in every phone
- OpenGL ES 1.1 ‚Äì Renders snes frames in full screen. Requires OpenGL ES 1.1, so it doesn‚Äôt work in all devices.

Screen Orientatuions: A restart is required after orientation has been changed

- portrait ‚Äì Default
- Landscape ‚Äì Normal landscape
- N-Gage ‚Äì landscape, but image is upside down. It‚Äôs meant for phones with ‚Äún-gage mode‚Äù like N95 and N96. The N96 can use the multimediakeys by default, but N95 users must use [Magic keys](http://www.symbian-freak.com/downloads/freeware/cat_s60_3rd/descriptions/systools/magic_keys_remap_and_extend_your_keyboard.htm) to map keys 1-4 to multimediakeys.

Frame skip:

- Auto ‚Äì continually adjust the frame skip speed to make your games play as smooth as possible
- User define speed ‚Äì some games might not run very well with Auto selection, since the frame rendering might take longer than a frame time with audio frame etc. Feel free to test different options, if you wish.

Show FPS:

- Off ‚Äì default
- On ‚Äì Show frames per second on upper left corner.

The Video settings modification takes effect, when AntSnes is started next time( a restart required).

### Audio Settings:

The Audio isn‚Äôt probably working. If you get it working, please post you config, phone and the game üôÇ  
Enable Audio: On/Off  
Sample Rate: 8000Hz, 11025Hz, 16000Hz, 22050Hz and 44100Hz can be chosen  
Stereo: On/Off  
Volume: Adjust volume  
Enable SpeedHack: On/Off. The SpeedHack makes audio render a bit faster, but it might cause some errors with some roms.  

### Key config
Start key config to configure keys. The multimediakeys are not supported in the key config, but you can use any normal keys in here.
