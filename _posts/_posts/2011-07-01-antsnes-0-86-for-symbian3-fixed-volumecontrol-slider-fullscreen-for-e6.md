AtnSnes is Snes9x emulator for Symbian. It is actually based on [DrPocketSNES](http://reesy.gp32x.de/DrPocketSnes.html "DrPocketSNES") version 6.4.4, which in turn is based on snes9x 1.39  
The new AntSnes comes with multitouch and with new transparent keys. You’ll need a Symbian^3 based phone to run this (N8, C7, E7 etc..). The old S60 5th edition is not supported by this version anymore. S60 5th edition users should use [AntSnesQt 0.7](/2386)  

### What’s new**
- fixed the volume control slider
- Added fullscreen support for E6

### Known issues: 
- Mounted shares(Dropbox etc.) breaks the filemanger, so do not use mounted shares.
- Does not work on Nokia 500, since it doesn’t have GPU.

### Installation:   
Just download and install. The installer contains a smartinstaller which will download and install Qt 4.7.3 for you if you don’t have it yet.  
  
### Download:     
Download the AntSnes 0.8.5 with the smart-installer: [ AntSnes v 0.8.6 (24408 downloads) ](/jekyll-export/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2011/07/AntSnes_086.sis)
