I just got iControlPad <http://icontrolpad.com/> and it seems to be without any problems on my N950 ðŸ™‚  
Hereâ€™s short instructions how to use it:

1. Start the iControlPad in keyboard mode (press A in startup)
2. Run the bluetooth pairing from the phone Settings/Bluetooth/Bluetooth devices/ and then select the iControlPad and set it as trusted device
3. Run the keyConfig from AntSnes under controls/ Run KeyConfig
4. enjoy iControlPad

The Symbian is not yet supported, but Iâ€™m working on it ðŸ˜‰
