MeBoy is a gameboy / gameboy color emulator for Nokia S40 full touch and Asha phones. The MeBoy is based on JavaBoy developed by Neil Millstone. I just made a simple UI for it for the Nokia Asha phones. It has been a quite some time from my previous emulator port for mobile phones, and I kind of got bored doing them. However hacking with Nokia Asha got me started with this kind of projects again, and it was fun ðŸ˜‰  
Currently the games with battery saves are not working, but Iâ€™m trying to fix it. Iâ€™m recommending simple games from the beginning of the GameBoy era such as Super Mario 1, Duck Tales etc.

### Compatibility

As said, currently only simple games without battery saves are supported. You can find &amp; edit the compatibility chart at MeBoy wiki-page at: <https://github.com/Summeli/MeBoy-Asha/wiki>

### Download

You can download the MeBoy free from Opera Appstore:

or if you want to support me, you can buy the paid version or give me a review on Nokia Store (that helps too). Please remember that most of the games are not working, so you should try the free version first.
