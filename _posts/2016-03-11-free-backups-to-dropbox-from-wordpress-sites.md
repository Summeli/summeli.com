I have WordPress based sites that I maintain. I haven’t been updating this blog for a while now. Hopefully I’ll get something neat done during this year.   

Here’s an easy way to take backups from WordPress blogs a zip archive to the Dropbox.  
1\. I downloaded the BackUpWordPress plugin to create zip-archives from my blog. It creates a zip file from all the blog database and from all content.  
2\. I upload the zip file to the Dropbox with WPB2D plugin. I have chosen only the wp-content/backupwordpress-xxx folder, so it will only upload the zip files that I have just created with the BackUpWordPress plugin.
