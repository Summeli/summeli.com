Heebo is an adaptation of the classic Match-3 genre puzzle game for the BlackBerry 10. Align the quirky Heebos into lines of three or more to turn the background into golden tiles. When all the background tiles are changed you win the level! Simple but highly addictive!  
Heebo is free software, licensed under the GPLv3. You can find the source code for BlackBerry 10 port from github: <https://github.com/Summeli/Heebo-BB10>
