It’s really hard to test the touch with N97, but at least the d-pad seems to be working better and start/select seem to be responding too 🙂  
The project has now a [wikipage at github](http://wiki.github.com/Summeli/AntSnes). See the FAQ before asking any questions 🙂  

### know issues:

AntSnes for the 5th edition

### Installation:   

Just download and install.  
If you got an error “unable to install”, or “certificate error” you might be having problems with the certificate. See my other blog post about two common fixes for this. [Fixing self-signed certificate related problems](/932)  

### Download:   
Sis installation file for 5th edition: [ AntSnes\_v071.sis (16045 downloads) ](/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2018/01/antsnes_071.sis)  
The S60 3rd edition should still use the old [ AntSnes 0.63](/845) release
