Minor 2023 update to my pfSense & Lancache configs. I migrated the ethernet ports for Lancache and pfSense in Proxmox, so I got one more ethernet port for Internet accesss. This could be used as a quick adhock connection with Android phone as it turns out that ethernet tethering is working pretty well on Android phones.

The [odd / even config](/posts/pfsense-odd-and-even-rules/) is still running smoothly.
